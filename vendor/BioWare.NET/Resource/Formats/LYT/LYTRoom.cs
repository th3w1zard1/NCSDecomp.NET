    /// WHAT IS A LYTRoom?
    ///
    /// A LYTRoom represents one room piece in a game area. It tells the game engine which 3D model
    /// to load and where to place it in 3D space.
    ///
    /// WHAT DATA DOES IT STORE?
    ///
    /// A LYTRoom stores:
    /// 1. Model: The name of the MDL file (3D model) that represents this room's visual appearance
    ///    - This is a ResRef (resource reference), which is a string up to 16 characters
    ///    - Example: "hallway_01" refers to the file "hallway_01.mdl"
    ///
    /// 2. Position: The X, Y, Z coordinates where this room should be placed in the game world
    ///    - X: East-west position (positive X = east, negative X = west)
    ///    - Y: North-south position (positive Y = north, negative Y = south)
    ///    - Z: Up-down position (positive Z = up, negative Z = down)
    ///    - Example: Position (10, 5, 0) means the room is 10 units east, 5 units north, at ground level
    ///
    /// HOW IT WORKS:
    ///
    /// When the game engine loads an area:
    /// 1. It reads all LYTRoom objects from the LYT file
    /// 2. For each room, it loads the MDL file specified by Model
    /// 3. It places the 3D model at the Position coordinates
    /// 4. All rooms together form the complete area geometry
    ///
    /// EXAMPLE:
    ///
    /// If you have a hallway made of three rooms:
    /// - Room 1: Model = "hallway_start", Position = (0, 0, 0)
    /// - Room 2: Model = "hallway_middle", Position = (10, 0, 0)
    /// - Room 3: Model = "hallway_end", Position = (20, 0, 0)
    ///
    /// The engine loads three MDL files and places them in a line, creating a hallway that's 30 units long.
    ///
    /// RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER FILES:
    ///
    /// - MDL file: The 3D model file that this room references
    /// - WOK file: The walkmesh file (usually has the same name as the MDL) that defines where characters can walk
    /// - LYT file: The layout file that contains this room definition
    ///
