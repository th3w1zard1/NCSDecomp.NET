    /// WHAT IS A LYTObstacle?
    ///
    /// A LYTObstacle represents a swoop track obstacle object used in racing mini-games. Obstacles
    /// block the player's path and must be avoided.
    ///
    /// WHAT DATA DOES IT STORE?
    ///
    /// A LYTObstacle stores:
    /// 1. Model: The name of the MDL file (3D model) that represents the obstacle's visual appearance
    ///    - This is usually a barrier, wall, or other blocking object
    ///
    /// 2. Position: The X, Y, Z coordinates where the obstacle should be placed
    ///    - The obstacle is placed on the racing track at this position
    ///
    /// HOW IT WORKS:
    ///
    /// During a swoop race:
    /// 1. The game engine loads obstacle models at the positions specified in the LYT file
    /// 2. The obstacles are placed on the track to make the race more challenging
    /// 3. The player must steer around them to avoid crashing
    /// 4. If the player hits an obstacle, they crash and lose the race
    ///
    /// These are only used in areas that have swoop racing tracks. Most areas have no obstacles.
    ///
    /// Matching PyKotor implementation at Libraries/PyKotor/src/pykotor/resource/formats/lyt/lyt_data.py
