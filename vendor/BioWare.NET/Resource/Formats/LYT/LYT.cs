    /// WHAT IS A LYT FILE?
    ///
    /// A LYT file is a layout file that tells the game engine how to assemble a game area from
    /// individual room pieces. Think of it like a blueprint that shows where each room should be
    /// placed in 3D space. The game engine reads this file to know which room models to load and
    /// where to position them.
    ///
    /// WHAT DATA DOES IT STORE?
    ///
    /// A LYT file contains four main lists:
    ///
    /// 1. ROOMS: A list of room definitions. Each room has:
    ///    - Model: The name of the 3D model file (MDL) that represents the room's visual appearance
    ///    - Position: The X, Y, Z coordinates where the room should be placed in the game world
    ///    - The game engine loads the MDL file and places it at this position
    ///
    /// 2. TRACKS: A list of swoop track booster positions (used in racing mini-games).
    ///    - Each track has a model name and position
    ///    - These are special objects placed on swoop racing tracks
    ///    - When the player drives over them, they get a speed boost
    ///
    /// 3. OBSTACLES: A list of swoop track obstacle positions (used in racing mini-games).
    ///    - Each obstacle has a model name and position
    ///    - These are objects that block the player's path during races
    ///    - The player must avoid them or crash
    ///
    /// 4. DOORHOOKS: A list of door hook points (door placement positions).
    ///    - Each door hook has:
    ///      - Room: The name of the room this door hook belongs to
    ///      - Door: The name of the door that should be placed here
    ///      - Position: The X, Y, Z coordinates where the door should be placed
    ///      - Orientation: A quaternion (4 numbers) that describes how the door should be rotated
    ///    - Door hooks tell the game where doors should be placed to connect rooms together
    ///    - When you walk through a door, the game uses these hooks to know where to place you
    ///
    /// HOW DOES THE GAME ENGINE USE LYT FILES?
    ///
    /// STEP 1: Loading Rooms
    /// - The engine reads the Rooms list
    /// - For each room, it loads the MDL model file
    /// - It places the model at the specified position
    /// - All rooms together form the complete area geometry
    ///
    /// STEP 2: Loading Tracks and Obstacles
    /// - The engine reads the Tracks and Obstacles lists (if present)
    /// - It loads the model files and places them at the specified positions
    /// - These are only used in areas with swoop racing tracks
    ///
    /// STEP 3: Placing Doors
    /// - The engine reads the DoorHooks list
    /// - For each door hook, it places a door at the specified position and orientation
    /// - Doors connect rooms together and allow the player to move between areas
    ///
    /// WHY ARE LYT FILES NEEDED?
    ///
    /// Without LYT files, the game engine wouldn't know:
    /// - Which room models to load
    /// - Where to place each room in 3D space
    /// - Where to place doors to connect rooms
    /// - Where to place special objects like track boosters and obstacles
    ///
    /// The LYT file acts as a map that tells the engine how to assemble the area from its pieces.
    ///
    /// RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER FILES:
    ///
    /// - MDL files: The 3D models referenced by Rooms, Tracks, and Obstacles
    /// - WOK files: The walkmesh files that define where characters can walk (one per room)
    /// - ARE files: The area definition files that contain lighting, fog, and other area properties
    /// - GIT files: The game instance template files that contain creatures, placeables, and other objects
    /// - VIS files: The visibility files that define which rooms can see each other
    ///
    /// Together, these files define a complete game area that the player can explore.
    ///
    /// ORIGINAL IMPLEMENTATION:
    ///
    /// [TODO: Function name] @ (K1: TODO: Find this address, TSL: TODO: Find this address address): LYT files are loaded when an area is initialized. The engine reads
    /// the room definitions and loads the corresponding MDL files, positioning them according to
    /// the LYT file's coordinates. Door hooks are used to place doors at the correct positions
    /// for area transitions.
