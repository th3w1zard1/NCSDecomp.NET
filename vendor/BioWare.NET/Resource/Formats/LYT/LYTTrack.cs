    /// WHAT IS A LYTTrack?
    ///
    /// A LYTTrack represents a swoop track booster object used in racing mini-games. When the player
    /// drives over a booster, they get a speed boost.
    ///
    /// WHAT DATA DOES IT STORE?
    ///
    /// A LYTTrack stores:
    /// 1. Model: The name of the MDL file (3D model) that represents the booster's visual appearance
    ///    - This is usually a simple model like a glowing pad or ring
    ///
    /// 2. Position: The X, Y, Z coordinates where the booster should be placed
    ///    - The booster is placed on the racing track at this position
    ///
    /// HOW IT WORKS:
    ///
    /// During a swoop race:
    /// 1. The game engine loads booster models at the positions specified in the LYT file
    /// 2. When the player's swoop bike touches a booster, the game applies a speed boost
    /// 3. The boost makes the player go faster for a short time
    ///
    /// These are only used in areas that have swoop racing tracks. Most areas have no tracks.
    ///
    /// Matching PyKotor implementation at Libraries/PyKotor/src/pykotor/resource/formats/lyt/lyt_data.py
