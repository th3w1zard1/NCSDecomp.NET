    /// WHAT IS AN IFO FILE?
    /// 
    /// An IFO file is a Module Info file that stores all the information about a game module.
    /// A module is a complete game area that the player can explore, like a planet, space station,
    /// or building. The IFO file tells the game engine everything it needs to know about the module,
    /// including where the player starts, which areas are in the module, what scripts to run, and
    /// what time of day it is.
    /// 
    /// WHAT DATA DOES IT STORE?
    /// 
    /// An IFO file contains:
    /// 
    /// 1. MODULE IDENTIFICATION:
    ///    - ModId: A unique 16-byte identifier that distinguishes this module from all others
    ///    - Name: The display name of the module (shown in-game, can be in different languages)
    ///    - ModName: An alternate name for the module
    ///    - ResRef: The resource reference (file name) of the module
    ///    - Tag: A tag identifier used by scripts to reference this module
    /// 
    /// 2. ENTRY POINT:
    ///    - EntryArea: Which area the player starts in when entering the module
    ///    - EntryX, EntryY, EntryZ: The exact position where the player appears
    ///    - EntryDirectionX, EntryDirectionY, EntryDirectionZ: Which direction the player faces
    ///    - EntryDirection: The angle (in degrees) the player faces (calculated from X/Y/Z components)
    /// 
    /// 3. AREA LIST:
    ///    - AreaList: A list of all areas (ARE files) that are part of this module
    ///    - Each area is a separate location the player can visit
    /// 
    /// 4. SCRIPT HOOKS:
    ///    - OnClientEnter: Script that runs when a player enters the module
    ///    - OnClientLeave: Script that runs when a player leaves the module
    ///    - OnHeartbeat: Script that runs periodically while the module is loaded
    ///    - OnUserDefined: Script that runs when triggered by other scripts
    ///    - OnActivateItem: Script that runs when the player activates an item
    ///    - OnAcquireItem: Script that runs when the player gets an item
    ///    - OnUnacquireItem: Script that runs when the player loses an item
    ///    - OnPlayerDeath: Script that runs when the player dies
    ///    - OnPlayerDying: Script that runs when the player is about to die
    ///    - OnPlayerRespawn: Script that runs when the player respawns
    ///    - OnPlayerRest: Script that runs when the player rests
    ///    - OnPlayerLevelUp: Script that runs when the player levels up
    ///    - OnPlayerCancelCutscene: Script that runs when the player cancels a cutscene
    ///    - OnLoad: Script that runs when the module is loaded
    ///    - OnStart: Script that runs when the module starts
    /// 
    /// 5. TIME SETTINGS:
    ///    - DawnHour: The hour of day when dawn begins (0-23)
    ///    - DuskHour: The hour of day when dusk begins (0-23)
    ///    - TimeScale: How fast time passes (1.0 = normal speed, 2.0 = twice as fast)
    ///    - StartMonth: The month the module starts in (1-12)
    ///    - StartDay: The day of month the module starts on (1-31)
    ///    - StartHour: The hour of day the module starts at (0-23)
    ///    - StartYear: The year the module starts in
    /// 
    /// 6. MODULE METADATA:
    ///    - Description: A description of the module (shown in toolset, not in-game)
    ///    - ModVersion: The version number of the module
    ///    - ExpansionPack: Which expansion pack is required (0 = base game, 1+ = expansion)
    ///    - VaultId: An ID used for multiplayer modules
    ///    - VoId: Voice-over ID (for modules with voice acting)
    ///    - Hak: Hak pack name (for modules that use hak packs)
    ///    - XpScale: Experience point scaling (1.0 = normal, 2.0 = double XP)
    ///    - StartMovie: A movie file to play when the module starts
    /// 
    /// HOW DOES THE GAME ENGINE USE IFO FILES?
    /// 
    /// STEP 1: Loading the Module
    /// - When the player enters a module, the engine loads the IFO file
    /// - It reads the EntryArea to know which area to load first
    /// - It reads the EntryX/Y/Z to know where to place the player
    /// - It reads the EntryDirection to know which way the player should face
    /// 
    /// STEP 2: Initializing the Module
    /// - The engine reads the AreaList to know which areas are available
    /// - It loads all the areas listed in AreaList
    /// - It sets up the time system using the time settings
    /// - It runs the OnLoad script (if present)
    /// 
    /// STEP 3: Running Scripts
    /// - When events happen (player enters, player dies, etc.), the engine runs the corresponding script
    /// - Scripts can modify the game world, spawn creatures, change dialogue, etc.
    /// 
    /// STEP 4: Managing Time
    /// - The engine uses the time settings to determine what time of day it is
    /// - It uses DawnHour and DuskHour to transition between day and night
    /// - It uses TimeScale to control how fast time passes
    /// 
    /// WHY ARE IFO FILES NEEDED?
    /// 
    /// Without IFO files, the game engine wouldn't know:
    /// - Where the player should start when entering a module
    /// - Which areas are part of the module
    /// - What scripts to run when events happen
    /// - What time of day it is
    /// - What the module's name and description are
    /// 
    /// The IFO file acts as a master configuration file that tells the engine everything about the module.
    /// 
    /// RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER FILES:
    /// 
    /// - ARE files: The area files listed in AreaList
    /// - GIT files: The game instance template files for each area
    /// - LYT files: The layout files for each area
    /// - NCS files: The compiled script files referenced by script hooks
    /// - MOD/RIM files: The module archive files that contain all these resources
    /// 
    /// Together, these files define a complete game module that the player can explore.
    /// 
    /// ORIGINAL IMPLEMENTATION:

    /// the entry point information to place the player, loads all areas in the AreaList, sets up
    /// the time system, and registers script hooks for event handling.
