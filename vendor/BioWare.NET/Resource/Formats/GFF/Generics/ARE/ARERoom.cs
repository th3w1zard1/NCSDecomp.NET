    /// WHAT IS AN AREROOM?
    ///
    /// An ARERoom represents a specific region within a game area. It's not the same as a
    /// LYT room (which is a 3D model piece). Instead, an ARERoom is an invisible region that
    /// defines special properties for that part of the area, like audio settings, weather
    /// behavior, and force rating modifiers.
    ///
    /// WHAT DATA DOES IT STORE?
    ///
    /// An ARERoom stores:
    ///
    /// 1. Name: A unique identifier for this room (referenced by VIS files)
    ///    - This name is used to identify the room in visibility calculations
    ///    - VIS files use room names to determine which rooms can see each other
    ///    - Example: "room_01", "hallway_main", "cave_entrance"
    ///
    /// 2. Weather: Whether weather effects are disabled in this room (KotOR 2 only)
    ///    - If true, rain, snow, and lightning don't appear in this room
    ///    - Used for indoor areas where weather shouldn't appear
    ///    - Only available in KotOR 2, not in KotOR 1
    ///
    /// 3. EnvAudio: The environment audio index for this room
    ///    - This is an index into the environment audio system
    ///    - Determines the acoustic properties (reverb, echo) of the room
    ///    - Different values create different sound effects (indoor, outdoor, cave, etc.)
    ///    - Example: 0 = outdoor, 1 = indoor, 2 = cave
    ///
    /// 4. ForceRating: The force rating modifier for this room (KotOR 2 only)
    ///    - This modifies the player's force rating when they're in this room
    ///    - Used for areas with special force properties (light side, dark side, etc.)
    ///    - Only available in KotOR 2, not in KotOR 1
    ///
    /// 5. AmbientScale: The ambient audio scaling factor for this room
    ///    - This multiplies the volume of ambient sounds in this room
    ///    - 1.0 = normal volume, 2.0 = twice as loud, 0.5 = half as loud
    ///    - Used to make some rooms louder or quieter than others
    ///
    /// HOW ARE ROOMS USED?
    ///
    /// STEP 1: Audio Zones
    /// - Each room defines its own audio properties (EnvAudio, AmbientScale)
    /// - When the player enters a room, the game switches to that room's audio settings
    /// - This creates different sound effects in different parts of the area
    ///
    /// STEP 2: Weather Control
    /// - Each room can disable weather effects (Weather = true)
    /// - Used for indoor areas where rain/snow shouldn't appear
    /// - Only works in KotOR 2
    ///
    /// STEP 3: Force Rating
    /// - Each room can modify the player's force rating (ForceRating)
    /// - Used for areas with special force properties
    /// - Only works in KotOR 2
    ///
    /// STEP 4: Visibility Calculations
    /// - VIS files use room names to determine which rooms can see each other
    /// - This affects which room models are rendered (culling)
    /// - Rooms that can't see each other don't render each other's models
    ///
    /// WHY ARE ROOMS NEEDED?
    ///
    /// Without rooms, the entire area would have the same audio properties, weather behavior,
    /// and force rating. Rooms allow different parts of the area to have different properties,
    /// creating more realistic and varied gameplay experiences.
    ///
    /// RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER FILES:
    ///
    /// - ARE files: Contain the list of rooms for the area
    /// - VIS files: Use room names to determine visibility between rooms
    /// - LYT files: Define the 3D model rooms (different from ARE rooms)
    ///
    /// Note: ARE rooms are NOT the same as LYT rooms. LYT rooms are 3D model pieces that
    /// make up the area's geometry. ARE rooms are invisible regions that define properties
    /// for parts of the area.
    ///
    /// ORIGINAL IMPLEMENTATION:
    ///
    /// [TODO: Function name] @ (K1: TODO: Find this address, TSL: TODO: Find this address address): Rooms are loaded when an area is initialized. The engine
    /// uses room names for visibility calculations and applies audio/weather/force properties
    /// based on which room the player is currently in.
