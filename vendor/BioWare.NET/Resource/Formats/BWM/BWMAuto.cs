    /// Provides convenient methods to read and write BWM files from various sources.
    /// </summary>

    /// WHAT IS BWMAUTO?
    /// 
    /// BWMAuto is a helper class that makes it easy to load and save BWM files. Instead of
    /// manually creating a BWMBinaryReader or BWMBinaryWriter, you can use these simple methods
    /// to read from files, byte arrays, or streams, and write to files, byte arrays, or streams.
    /// 
    /// HOW TO USE IT:
    /// 
    /// READING A BWM FILE:
    /// 
    /// From a file path:
    /// BWM bwm = BWMAuto.ReadBwm("path/to/file.wok");
    /// 
    /// From a byte array:
    /// byte[] data = File.ReadAllBytes("file.wok");
    /// BWM bwm = BWMAuto.ReadBwm(data);
    /// 
    /// From a stream:
    /// using (FileStream stream = File.OpenRead("file.wok"))
    /// {
    ///     BWM bwm = BWMAuto.ReadBwm(stream);
    /// }
    /// 
    /// WRITING A BWM FILE:
    /// 
    /// To a file path:
    /// BWMAuto.WriteBwm(bwm, "path/to/output.wok");
    /// 
    /// To a byte array:
    /// byte[] data = BWMAuto.BytesBwm(bwm);
    /// 
    /// To a stream:
    /// using (FileStream stream = File.Create("output.wok"))
    /// {
    ///     BWMAuto.WriteBwm(bwm, stream);
    /// }
    /// 
    /// WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU READ A BWM?
    /// 
    /// When you call ReadBwm, it:
    /// 1. Creates a BWMBinaryReader with your source (file, bytes, or stream)
    /// 2. Calls reader.Load() which:
    ///    - Reads the file header (walkmesh type, vertex count, face count, etc.)
    ///    - Reads all vertices (x, y, z coordinates)
    ///    - Reads all faces (triangles with vertex indices and materials)
    ///    - Reads the AABB tree (if it's an AreaModel walkmesh)
    ///    - Reads transition information (if it's an AreaModel walkmesh)
    ///    - Creates a BWM object with all this data
    /// 3. Returns the BWM object
    /// 
    /// WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU WRITE A BWM?
    /// 
    /// When you call WriteBwm or BytesBwm, it:
    /// 1. Creates a BWMBinaryWriter with your BWM object and target (file, stream, or byte array)
    /// 2. Calls writer.Write() which:
    ///    - Writes the file header (walkmesh type, vertex count, face count, etc.)
    ///    - Writes all vertices (x, y, z coordinates)
    ///    - Writes all faces (triangles with vertex indices and materials)
    ///    - Writes the AABB tree (if it's an AreaModel walkmesh)
    ///    - Writes transition information (if it's an AreaModel walkmesh)
    /// 3. Returns the written data (for BytesBwm) or writes to file/stream (for WriteBwm)
    /// 
    /// FILE FORMAT SUPPORT:
    /// 
    /// Currently, only WOK (AreaModel) format is supported. PWK and DWK (PlaceableOrDoor)
    /// formats are not yet implemented, but the BWM class can represent them in memory.
    /// 
    /// OFFSET AND SIZE PARAMETERS:
    /// 
    /// The offset parameter lets you read a BWM from a specific position in the source.
    /// This is useful if the BWM data is embedded in a larger file (like an ERF archive).
    /// 
    /// The size parameter lets you limit how much data is read. If null, it reads until
    /// the end of the source. This is useful if you know the exact size of the BWM data.
    /// 
    /// ORIGINAL IMPLEMENTATION:
    /// 
    /// [TODO: Function name] @ (K1: TODO: Find this address, TSL: TODO: Find this address address): The original engine loads BWM files directly from disk or
    /// from ERF/BIF archives. The file format is binary and includes header, vertices,
    /// faces, AABB tree, and transition data.
    /// 
    /// Matching PyKotor implementation at Libraries/PyKotor/src/pykotor/resource/formats/bwm/bwm_auto.py
    /// Original: read_bwm, write_bwm, bytes_bwm
