    /// WHAT IS A BWM FILE?
    ///
    /// A BWM file is a file format used by BioWare games to store walkmesh data. A walkmesh is a simplified
    /// 3D model made of triangles that defines where characters can walk, where they cannot walk, and how
    /// high the ground is at different locations.
    ///
    /// BWM files come in three types:
    /// - WOK (Area Walkmesh): Used for entire areas/modules. Contains vertices in world coordinates,
    ///   includes an AABB tree for fast spatial queries, has walkable adjacency information, and
    ///   perimeter edges for transitions between areas.
    /// - PWK (Placeable Walkmesh): Used for placeable objects (chests, tables, etc.). Contains vertices
    ///   in local coordinates (relative to the placeable's position), collision-only (no pathfinding),
    ///   typically no AABB tree.
    /// - DWK (Door Walkmesh): Used for doors. Similar to PWK, contains vertices in local coordinates,
    ///   collision-only, typically no AABB tree.
    ///
    /// THE DATA STRUCTURE:
    ///
    /// WalkmeshType: Tells us whether this is an AreaModel (WOK) or PlaceableOrDoor (PWK/DWK).
    ///
    /// Faces: A list of triangles. Each triangle has three vertices (V1, V2, V3), a surface material
    /// (which determines if it's walkable), and optional transition indices (Trans1, Trans2, Trans3) for
    /// connecting to other areas.
    ///
    /// Position: The position of the walkmesh in world space. For area walkmeshes, this is usually (0,0,0).
    /// For placeable/door walkmeshes, this is the position of the object in the world.
    ///
    /// RelativeHook1/RelativeHook2: Hook points relative to the walkmesh's local coordinate system.
    /// These are used for connecting walkmeshes together (e.g., connecting a door to a room).
    ///
    /// AbsoluteHook1/AbsoluteHook2: Hook points in world coordinates. These are the actual positions
    /// where connections happen in the game world.

        /// HOW IT WORKS:
        ///
        /// The tree is built using a recursive top-down approach:
        /// 1. Start with all triangles in one big box (the root)
        /// 2. Split the box in half along the longest axis (X, Y, or Z)

        /// 4. Recursively split each box until each box contains only one triangle (a leaf node)
        ///
        /// THE TREE STRUCTURE:
        ///
        /// - Internal nodes: Boxes that contain other boxes. They have Left and Right child pointers.
        /// - Leaf nodes: Boxes that contain exactly one triangle. They have a Face pointer instead of children.
        ///
        /// Each node stores:
        /// - BbMin: The minimum corner of the bounding box (smallest X, Y, Z values)
        /// - BbMax: The maximum corner of the bounding box (largest X, Y, Z values)
        /// - Face: The triangle (only for leaf nodes, null for internal nodes)
        /// - Sigplane: Which axis was used to split this node (X=1, Y=2, Z=3, or 0 for leaf nodes)
        /// - Left: Pointer to the left child node (null for leaf nodes)
        /// - Right: Pointer to the right child node (null for leaf nodes)
        ///
        /// WHY ONLY AREA WALKMESHES GET AABB TREES:
        ///
        /// - Area walkmeshes (WOK files) can have thousands of triangles, so an AABB tree is essential

        ///
        /// STEP 4: Handle Coplanar Triangles
        /// - If all triangles have the same center position along the split axis, we can't split them

        /// STEP 5: Split Triangles

        ///
        /// WHAT IS A RAYCAST?
        ///
        /// A raycast is like shooting an invisible laser and seeing what it hits. The ray starts at the origin
        /// point and travels in the direction specified, up to maxDistance units away. If the ray hits a
        /// triangle, this function returns which triangle was hit and how far away it was.
        ///
        /// HOW IT WORKS:
        ///
        /// For Area Walkmeshes (WOK):
        /// - Uses the AABB tree to quickly find which triangles might be hit
        /// - Traverses the tree, testing the ray against bounding boxes
        /// - Only tests triangles that are in boxes the ray passes through
        /// - Much faster than checking every triangle
        ///
        /// For Placeable/Door Walkmeshes (PWK/DWK):
        /// - Uses brute force: checks every triangle
        /// - This is fine because these walkmeshes are small (usually only a few triangles)

        /// By default, only tests triangles with walkable materials. You can specify a different set of
        /// materials to test against if needed (e.g., to test only non-walkable materials for collision).
        ///
        /// THE ALGORITHM:
        ///
        /// 1. If no materials specified, default to walkable materials
        /// 2. If this is a placeable/door walkmesh, use brute force (check all triangles)
        /// 3. If this is an area walkmesh:
        ///    a. Build or get the AABB tree
        ///    b. Find the root node (node with no parent)
        ///    c. Recursively traverse the tree, testing ray against bounding boxes
        ///    d. When we reach a leaf node (single triangle), test ray against that triangle

        /// HOW IT WORKS:
        ///
        /// For each triangle in the walkmesh:
        /// - Takes vertex V1 and adds (x, y, z) to it: new V1 = (V1.X + x, V1.Y + y, V1.Z + z)
